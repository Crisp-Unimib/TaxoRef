Malandri, L., Mercorio, F., Mezzanzanica, M., & Nobani, N. TaxoRef: Embeddings Evaluation for AI-driven Taxonomy Refinement.

This repository implements the taxonomy refinement phase developed in the following article:
"TaxoRef: Embeddings Evaluation for AI-drivenTaxonomy Refinement"
Malandri, L., Mercorio, F., Mezzanzanica, M., & Nobani, N.


The notebook TaxoRef.ipynb contains the code, complete and commented.

The embedding generation and selection phase, thorougly described in the article, is not included, because it can be built with any pair corpus-taxonomy following the description in the paper.
